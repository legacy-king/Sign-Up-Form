Sign-Up Form Project - The Odin Project

This project is a sign-up form for an imaginary service, created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The goal is to apply knowledge of HTML forms and advanced CSS styling, including custom fonts, layout techniques, and pseudo-classes.

About The Project

This project's primary objective was to build a visually appealing and functional sign-up form from a design mockup. It demonstrates the ability to structure a web page with semantic HTML and style it accurately with CSS, focusing on creating a clean, two-column layout and styling form elements for a better user experience.
Key Features

    Two-Column Layout: The page is structured using CSS Flexbox to create a distinct image sidebar and a main content area for the form.
    Custom Font: Features a custom font (Norse-Bold) for the logo, loaded using the @font-face rule.
    Styled Form Elements: All form inputs and the submit button are custom-styled to match the design mockup.
    Dynamic Input Validation: Inputs use the :focus pseudo-class to provide visual feedback when selected, and the :invalid pseudo-class to indicate when a required field is empty or the data is incorrect. This provides immediate, client-side feedback without any JavaScript.
    Overlayed Logo Banner: The logo sits on a semi-transparent banner that is positioned over the background image, demonstrating the use of CSS position: relative and position: absolute.

Technologies Used

    HTML5: For the structure and semantics of the page and form.
    CSS3: For all styling, including:
        Flexbox for the main page layout and form element alignment.
        Custom Properties (Variables) for maintainable colors and fonts.
        @font-face for loading external fonts.
        Pseudo-classes (:focus, :invalid) for interactive form styling.
        Box Model (padding, margin, border).
        Box Shadow for depth and emphasis.

What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to solidify several key CSS concepts:

    Layout Mastery: Gained significant practice with Flexbox for creating robust page layouts.
    Advanced Positioning: Understood the practical difference between position: relative and position: absolute to create the logo overlay effect.
    Form Styling: Learned how to take control of default browser styles for forms and create a custom, branded look. The use of :focus and :invalid was a key takeaway for creating a more interactive and user-friendly experience directly with CSS.
